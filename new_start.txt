welocme Because pipelines are integral to the functioning of a Linux system, 
this chapter introduces them for use in examples. 
Pipelines are covered in detail beginning on page 145. 
Pipelines do not work with macOS resource forks; they work with data forks only. 
A pipeline (denoted by a pipe symbol that is written as a vertical bar [|] 
on the com- mand line and appears as a solid or broken vertical line on a keyboard) 
takes the output of one utility and sends that output as input to another utility. 
More accu- rately, a pipeline takes standard output of one process and redirects 
it to become standard input of another process. See page 137 
for more information on standard output and standard input.
