welocme Because pipelines are integral to the functioning of a Linux system, this chapter introduces them for use in examples. Pipelines are covered in detail beginning on page 145. Pipelines do not work with macOS resource forks; they work with data forks only.

A pipeline (denoted by a pipe symbol that is written as a vertical bar [|] on the com- mand line and appears as a solid or broken vertical line on a keyboard) takes the output of one utility and sends that output as input to another utility. More accu- rately, a pipeline takes standard output of one process and redirects it to become standard input of another process. See page 137 for more information on standard output and standard input.
